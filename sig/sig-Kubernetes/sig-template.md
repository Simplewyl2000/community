English | [简体中文](./sig-template_cn.md)

Kubernetes SIG is committed to focusing on the cloud native ecology with Kubernetes as its core. Through [KubeSphere](https://github.com/kubesphere/kubesphere), it can seamlessly bridge the cloud native ecosystem tools with openEuler, and reduces the installation and learning curve of Kubernetes, in order to enable openEuler users to quickly set up a container platform.

KubeSphere is an open source container platform built on Kubernetes, help users to set up a cloud native stack, and provides the wizard web console. It has passed CNCF Kubernetes conformance test and Taishan 200 compatibility test.

## SIG Mission

- Support for one-click installation of native Kubernetes and related cloud native tools on top of openEuler
- Offer KubeSphere as the the standard Kubernetes distribution, adapts it onto openEuler
- Provide full-stack and open source DevOps capabilities based on openEuler

## SIG Scope

- Making Kubernetes and KubeSphere are adapted to openEuler for quick installation,
- Working for the iteration and continuous maintenance, response to users feedback, solve related questions
- Kubernetes SIG group related documents, members, meetings, mailing lists, IRC management

### Deliverables

Installer (tgz package), code, documents.
