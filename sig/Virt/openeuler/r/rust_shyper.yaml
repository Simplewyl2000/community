description: Rust-Shyper is an embedded type-1 hypervisor built with Rust, 
  which has both high performance and high reliability. We have proposed 
  low overhead VM migration and hypervisor live-update mechanisms to 
  enable Rust-Shyper to tolerate hardware faults at runtime and dynamically 
  fix hypervisor bugs.
