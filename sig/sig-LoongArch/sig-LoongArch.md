
# Application to create a new SIG
English | [简体中文](./sig-template_cn.md)


Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

### Mission

- Support enabling LoongArch platforms on openEuler

- Coordinate LoongArch update to match the release roadmap with openEuler.

- Help software like kernel, GCC、LLVM、Rust, basic libraries, tools merge into openEuler.

- Coordinate LoongArch of the other community  match the release roadmap with openEuler.

- Coordinate LoongArch ecological chain partners and openEuler community in ecological construction

### Scope

-Organize firmware, kernel, toolchain, basic library, virtual machine, API environment and other basic software submit to openEuler community

-Promote the reverse migration of loongarch architecture patches from the upstream community to openEuler

-Promote openEuler patches submit to the upstream community

-Coordinate the complete-system vendor, firmware and other ecological chains to participate in openEuler

### Deliverables

- Source code

- ISO、images、repo

- Documentation 
 

### Repositories and description managed by this SIG

- Source code
  - [LoongArch-kernel](https://gitee.com/src-openeuler/kernel/tree/openEuler-22.03-LTS-LoongArch): Kernel of openEuler-2203 LoongArch branch.

### Cross-domain and external-oriented processes

Cross-domain and externally-oriented processes and actions defined and implemented by this SIG:
