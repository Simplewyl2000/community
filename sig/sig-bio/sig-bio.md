Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

Describe the Mission and objectives of the new SIG, including but not limited to:

- Why create a new SIG in openEuler  
  Driven by the rapid development of genetic technology and emergent
  public health problems, bioinformatics research has become one of the
  main application scenarios of high-performance computing and cloud
  computing. Currently, there are many open-source software in the field
  of bioinformatics. For different OS, the software may have
  compatibility issues. At the same time, software dependencies and
  version management are complicated, which leads developers to solve
  complex installation problems when deploying related software. In
  order to solve this problem, each OS release usually provides a
  corresponding information package. Similarly, openEuler also needs to
  provide corresponding mechanisms to solve application problems in the
  field of bioinformatics.

- The scope of the SIG 
 
  - Solve the technical problems of the adaptation of bioinformatics
    software on openEuler, and provide easy installation and good system
    consistency of the bioinformatics open-source software installation
    package
    
  - Build an official bioinformatics software warehouse based on
    openEuler, provide a wealth of bioinformatics software packages,
    covering a wide range of bioinformatics application scenarios
    
  - Connect OS users and developers of the bioinformatics open-source
    software community to obtain user demands and promote the adaptation
    and evolution of upstream software in openEuler

- The SIG roadmap
 
  -  2021 target: Provide more than 60 high-frequency open-source
     bioinformatics software packages, with the ability to serve
     high-frequency information research scenarios, enter openEuler
     21.09 version of the main line.
     
  -  Long-term evolution goal: to build a software warehouse covering
     mainstream bioinformatics application scenarios and form a benign
     interaction with upstream communities.
