description: Linux in itself is not real time capable. With the additional PREEMPT_RT patch it gains real-time capabilities.
  The key point of the PREEMPT_RT patch is to minimize the amount of kernel code that is non-preemptible, 
  while also minimizing the amount of code that must be changed in order to provide this added preemptibility. 
  In particular, critical sections, interrupt handlers, and interrupt-disable code sequences are normally preemptible. 
  The PREEMPT_RT patch leverages the SMP capabilities of the Linux kernel to add this extra preemptibility without 
  requiring a complete kernel rewrite. 
  Features of PREEMPT_RT:
        1.Preemptible critical sections
        2.Preemptible interrupt handlers
        3.Preemptible "interrupt disable" code sequences
        4.Priority inheritance for in-kernel spinlocks and semaphores
        5.Deferred operations
        6.Latency-reduction measures
