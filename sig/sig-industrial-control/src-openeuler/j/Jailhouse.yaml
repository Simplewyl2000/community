name: Jailhouse
description: Jailhouse is a partitioning Hypervisor based on Linux. It is able to run 
  bare-metal applications or (adapted) operating systems besides Linux. For this purpose, 
  it configures CPU and device virtualization features of the hardware platform in a way 
  that none of these domains, called "cells" here, can interfere with each other in an unacceptable way.
