Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README] (/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance] (/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

src-openeuler当前已经有超过2000个软件包，而openeuler中不超过30个开源项目。
从这个差异中可以看出openEuler作为一个发行版，绝大部分软件来自其他的上游开源软件社区。
为了openEuler本身的健康发展，我们需要对上游开源软件的发布情况，与openEuler自身的跟进发布情况有完整的洞察。

src-openeuler already has more than 2000 packages, while openeuler hosts less than 30 projects for now.
It's obvious that openEuler as a distribution, it imports most of the software components from upstream open source communities.
For healthy growth of openEuler, we need full insight of the release information of upstream open source communities, and the status of openEuler follow up.

But we don't have this information now.
While gitee can provide statistic on software development activities, it cannot provide and information on version on open source softwares.

This SIG focus on developing software to progressively make maintenance in src-openeuler auto.

The plan is to achieve goal in 3 phases.

1. Be able to provide automatic insight on open source components in openEuler Main and LTS, assist TC to make decisions.
2. For those software components already exist in src-openeuler, be able to automatically remind maintainer to upgrade. Implement the software maintenance and upgrade policy by tools.
3. For those software components already exist in src-openeuler, be able to semi-auto upgrade, so the community developers can invest more into innovation and introducing new software componenents.
