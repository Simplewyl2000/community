## SIG Mission and Scope

Describe the Mission and objectives of the new SIG, including but not limited to:

- The necessity of sig-OS-Builder  

- The construction, installation, and upgrade functions of iso are the basic core capabilities that Linux distributors must have.  
- In order to allow OSV and enthusiasts who use openEuler to implement custom build and installation more conveniently and quickly.  
- Through the continuous development of this sig, provide better installation and upgrade solutions.  

### Business scope of sig-OS-Builder

1. Maintain related software packages, including:
- openEuler boot: grub2, syslinux, uboot, etc.  
- openEuler install: anaconda, python-blivet, pykickstart, etc.  
- openEuler upgrade: dnf, libdnf, libsolv, etc.  
- openEuler construct: lorax, kiwi, etc.  

2. Provide more convenient ISO construct/icons_change methods.  
3. Provide more types of installation and upgrade solutions, such as: netinstall, dual-zone upgrade, etc.
