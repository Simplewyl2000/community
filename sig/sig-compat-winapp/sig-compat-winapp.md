# Compat-winapp SIG

English | [简体中文](./sig-compat-winapp_cn.md)

Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

Compatibility Winapp sig group is mainly dedicated to introducing massive Windows applications for X86 platform into openeuler system with X86/arm architecture. We will provide perfect construction solutions and guidance documents, to attract more people to join in.

## Mission

- With the development of localization of the information industry, a large number of X86 Windows applications have no excellent alternatives products on the Linux platform. This not only severely influence users’ willingness to choose localized operation systems, but also greatly affects users’ experience. In the process of solving this problem, we have used Wine to complete a large number of X86 Windows application porting based on linux, and we have also done a lot of research on cross-hardware platforms. In order to give back to the open-source community, we hope to create this SIG group with the openEuler community, and work with more friends who are interested in application compatibility to promote the domestic operation system and make it have better compatibility and become more user-friendly.

- This SIG group will introduce our Wine solution into the openEuler community, and combine with emulator technologies such as Qemu/Box86/Exagear to enable X86 Windows applications to run on more hardware platforms.

## Scope

- Introduce the Wine solution to solve various bugs in the application adaptation process
- research qemu, box86, etc. to implement cross-hardware platform compatibility solutions
- Giving back to the upstream community
- Respond to user feedback in a timely manner and solve related problems
