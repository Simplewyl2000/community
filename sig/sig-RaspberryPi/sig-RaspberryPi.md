# openEuler RaspberryPi Special Interest Group (SIG)
English | [简体中文](./sig-RaspberryPi_cn.md)

The openEuler RaspberryPi SIG aims at migrating openEuler to Raspberry Pi, in order to reduce the threshold for using openEuler and promote openEuler to new users.


## SIG Mission and Scope

### Mission
- Add RaspberryPi support for openEuler community
- According to the iterative version of openEuler, constantly complete the migration of openEuler to Raspberry Pi, and provide scripts for building openEuler image on Raspberry Pi and documents
- Respond to users' feedback in a timely manner and resolve the problems

### Scope

- Migrate openEuler kernel to Raspberry PI, with further maintenance and upgrades
- Create and update openEuler image running on Raspberry Pi, provide image's build scripts and documents
- Manage the documentations, meetings, mailist and IRC within RaspberryPi SIG

### Deliverables

- Source and tar
