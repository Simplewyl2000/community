description: This module provides Kerberos 5 credential cache collection utilities
  for Python. When a user authenticates to a Kerberos realm, the user has a short-lived
  credential in a cache. You can use this cccolutils module to easily determine if
  the user has any valid Kerberos credentials, or what the username is for a particular
  Kerberos realm.
