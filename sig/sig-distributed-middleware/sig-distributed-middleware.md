English | [简体中文](sig-distributed-middleware_cn.md)

Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README](/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance](/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

- Based on the openEuler operating system, the distributed system collaboration capability is introduced to build differentiated system competitiveness.
- openEuler supports native distributed file systems, distributed data management systems, and distributed device discovery, authentication, and connection capabilities.
- Provides stable and efficient unified distributed interfaces based on openEuler's distributed services, simplifying application development.
- The distributed soft bus technology is used to realize the ecological interworking of servers, intelligent terminals, and embedded devices to achieve the "1 + 1 > 2" effect and support community users to explore a wider industry space.

## SIG Scope

- Migration, expansion, maintenance, and upgrade of distributed collaboration capabilities in openEuler.
- Planning and implementation of distributed collaboration requirements.
- Manages documents, conferences, and emails in distributed collaboration.

### Deliverables

- Middleware related to distributed collaboration capabilities.
- Usage Guide for Native Distributed Interfaces.
- Distributed solution oriented to actual application scenarios and industries.
