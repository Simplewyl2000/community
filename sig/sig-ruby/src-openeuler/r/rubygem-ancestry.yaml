description: Ancestry is a gem that allows the records of a Ruby on Rails ActiveRecord
  model to be organised as a tree structure (or hierarchy). It employs the materialised
  path pattern and exposes all the standard tree structure relations (ancestors, parent,
  root, children, siblings, descendants), allowing all of them to be fetched in a
  single SQL query. Additional features include STI support, scopes, depth caching,
  depth constraints, easy migration from older gems, integrity checking, integrity
  restoration, arrangement of (sub)trees into hashes, and various strategies for dealing
  with orphaned records.
