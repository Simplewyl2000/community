# openEuler Community Code of Conduct

The openEuler community complies with the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/) adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org) V1.4.



If you need to report insults, harassment, or other unacceptable behavior, send an email to tc@openeuler.org to contact the openEuler Technical Committee.



## Our Pledge

To build an open and friendly environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, belief, or sexual identity and orientation.



## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Friendly and inclusive wording
* Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Demonstrating kindness toward other people

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention of any kind
* Disruption, incitement, rumor-making, insulting, derogatory comments, and personal and political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' information, such as physical and email addresses, without their explicit authorization
* Other conduct that can reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting



## Our Responsibilities

Community project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of "proper conduct" and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any conduct that they deem inappropriate.

Community project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, and issues that violate this Code of Conduct, and will temporarily or permanently ban any participant because of the behavior they consider to be inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.



## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and applies when an individual represents the community in public spaces.

Examples of representing the community include using an official email address, posting through an official media account, and participating in online or offline events as an appointed representative.

Community project maintainers can further define and interpret the conduct of representing the community.



## Enforcement

Send a letter to tc@openeuler.org to report abuse, harassment, and misconduct to the project team.

The maintenance team will review and investigate all complaints and respond to them appropriately as necessary. The project team is obligated to keep reporter information confidential. Specific enforcement guidelines may be issued separately.

Project maintenance personnel who fail to strictly comply with or enforce this Code of Conduct may be temporarily or permanently disqualified from participating in the project upon the resolution of the project owner or other members.
