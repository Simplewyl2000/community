# Application to create bootstrap SIG
English | [简体中文](./README.md)

Note: The Charter of this SIG follows the convention described in the openEuler charter [README] (/en/governance/README.md), and follows [SIG-governance] (/en/technical-committee/governance/SIG-governance.md).

## SIG Mission and Scope

This SIG intends to manage _all_ software packages introduced into openEuler in binary format for bootstraping purpose.

There're which need themselves to build, which are known as [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping)
We have to introduce pre-build binaries for bootstrapping, while pre-build binaries are openEuler community tries to avoid.
So, we propose to set and standalone SIG to manage this special scenario.

### Deliverables

This SIG will manage pre-build binary software packages.
All these packages should be managed in automation.
